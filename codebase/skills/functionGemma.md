FunctionGemma is a specialized version of the Gemma 3 270M model, trained specifically for function calling improvements. It has the same architecture as Gemma, but uses a different chat format and tokenizer.

This guide shows the complete workflow for using FunctionGemma within the Hugging Face ecosystem. It covers the essential setup steps, including installing necessary Python packages like `torch` and `transformers`, and loading the model via the Hugging Face Hub. The core of the tutorial demonstrates a three-stage cycle for connecting the model to external tools: the **Model's Turn** to generate function call objects, the **Developer's Turn** to parse and execute code (such as a weather API), and the **Final Response** where the model uses the tool's output to answer the user.

## Setup

Before starting this tutorial, complete the following steps:

- Get access to FunctionGemma by logging into [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/google/functiongemma-270m-it) and selecting **Acknowledge license** for a FunctionGemma model.
- Generate a Hugging Face [Access Token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens#how-to-manage-user-access-token) and add it to your Colab environment.

This notebook will run on either CPU or GPU.

## Install Python packages

Install the Hugging Face libraries required for running the FunctionGemma model and making requests.

    # Install PyTorch & other libraries
    pip install torch

    # Install the transformers library
    pip install transformers

After you have accepted the license, you need a valid Hugging Face Token to access the model.

    # Login into Hugging Face Hub
    from huggingface_hub import login
    login()

## Load Model

Use the `torch` and `transformers` libraries to create an instance of a `processor` and `model` using the `AutoProcessor` and `AutoModelForCausalLM` classes as shown in the following code example:

    from transformers import AutoProcessor, AutoModelForCausalLM

    GEMMA_MODEL_ID = "google/functiongemma-270m-it"

    processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(GEMMA_MODEL_ID, device_map="auto")
    model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(GEMMA_MODEL_ID, dtype="auto", device_map="auto")

## Example Use Cases

Function calling connects the generative capabilities of Gemma and the external data and services. Here are some common applications:

- **Answering Questions with Real-Time Data:** Use a search engine or weather API to answer questions like "What's the weather in Tokyo?" or "Who won the latest F1 race?"
- **Controlling External Systems:** Connect Gemma to other applications to perform actions, such as sending emails ("Send a reminder to the team about the meeting"), managing a calendar, or controlling smart home devices.
- **Creating Complex Workflows**: Chain multiple tool calls together to accomplish multi-step tasks, like planning a trip by finding flights, booking a hotel, and creating a calendar event.

## Using Tools

The core of function calling involves a four-step process:

1. **Define Tools**: Create the functions your model can use, specifying arguments and descriptions (e.g., a weather lookup function).
2. **Model's Turn**: FunctionGemma receives the user's prompt and a list of available tools. It generates a special object indicating which function to call and with what arguments instead of a plain text response.
3. **Developer's Turn**: Your code receives this object, executes the specified function with the provided arguments, and formats the result to be sent back to the model.
4. **Final Response**: FunctionGemma uses the function's output to generate a final, user-facing response.

Let's simulate this process.

    # Define a function that our model can use.
    def get_current_weather(location: str, unit: str = "celsius"):
        """
        Gets the current weather in a given location.

        Args:
            location: The city and state, e.g. "San Francisco, CA" or "Tokyo, JP"
            unit: The unit to return the temperature in. (choices: ["celsius", "fahrenheit"])

        Returns:
            temperature: The current temperature in the given location
            weather: The current weather in the given location
        """
        return {"temperature": 15, "weather": "sunny"}

### Model's Turn

Here's the user prompt `"Hey, what's the weather in Tokyo right now?"`, and the tool `[get_current_weather]`. FunctionGemma generates a function call object as follows.

    prompt = "Hey, what's the weather in Tokyo right now?"
    tools = [get_current_weather]

    message = [
            # ESSENTIAL SYSTEM PROMPT:
            # This line activates the model's function calling logic.
            {"role": "developer", "content": "You are a model that can do function calling with the following functions"},
            {"role": "user", "content": prompt},
    ]

    inputs = processor.apply_chat_template(message, tools=tools, add_generation_prompt=True, return_dict=True, return_tensors="pt")
    output = processor.decode(inputs["input_ids"][0], skip_special_tokens=False)

    out = model.generate(**inputs.to(model.device), pad_token_id=processor.eos_token_id, max_new_tokens=128)
    generated_tokens = out[0][len(inputs["input_ids"][0]):]
    output = processor.decode(generated_tokens, skip_special_tokens=True)

    print(f"Prompt: {prompt}")
    print(f"Tools: {tools}")
    print(f"Output: {output}")

```
Prompt: Hey, what's the weather in Tokyo right now?
Tools: [<function get_current_weather at 0x79b7e0f52e80>]
Output: <start_function_call>call:get_current_weather{location:<escape>Tokyo, Japan<escape>}<end_function_call>
```
>
> > [!NOTE]
> > **Note:** To ensure FunctionGemma correctly interprets the available tools and generates a structured call instead of plain text, the **developer** message is essential. This specific system prompt instructs the model that it has permission and capability to perform function calling.

    message = [

            {"role": "user", "content": prompt},
    ]

### Developer's Turn

Your application should parse the model's response to extract function name and argments, and append function call result with the `tool` role.

                except: return {'true': True, 'false': False}.get(v.lower(), v.strip("'\""))

        return [{

                k: cast((v1 or v2).strip())
                for k, v1, v2 in re.findall(r"(\w+):(?:<escape>(.*?)<escape>|([^,}]*))", args)
            }
        } for name, args in re.findall(r"<start_function_call>call:(\w+)\{(.*?)\}<end_function_call>", text, re.DOTALL)]

    calls = extract_tool_calls(output)
    if calls:
        message.append({

        results = [
            {"name": c['name'], "response": globals()[c['name']](**c['arguments'])}
            for c in calls

    message.append({
        "role": "tool",
        "content": {
            "name": function_name,
            "response": function_response
        }
    })

In case of multiple independent requests:

    message.append({
        "role": "tool",
        "content": [
            {
                "name": function_name_1,
                "response": function_response_1
            },
            {
                "name": function_name_2,
                "response": function_response_2
            }
        ]
    })

### Final Response

Finally, FunctionGemma reads the tool response and reply to the user.

    inputs = processor.apply_chat_template(message, tools=tools, add_generation_prompt=True, return_dict=True, return_tensors="pt")
    out = model.generate(**inputs.to(model.device), pad_token_id=processor.eos_token_id, max_new_tokens=128)
    generated_tokens = out[0][len(inputs["input_ids"][0]):]
    output = processor.decode(generated_tokens, skip_special_tokens=True)
    print(f"Output: {output}")
    message.append({"role": "assistant", "content": output})

```
Output: The current weather in Tokyo is sunny with a temperature of 15 degrees Celsius.
```

You can see the full chat history below.

    # full history
    for item in message:
      print(item)

    print("-"*80)
    output = processor.decode(out[0], skip_special_tokens=False)
    print(f"Output: {output}")

## Summary and next steps

You have established how to build an application that can calls functions with FunctionGemma. The workflow is established through a four-stage cycle:

1. **Define Tools**: Create the functions your model can use, specifying arguments and descriptions (e.g., a weather lookup function).
2. **Model's Turn**: The model receives the user's prompt and a list of available tools, returning a structured function call object instead of plain text.
3. **Developer's Turn**: The developer parses this output using regular expressions to extract function names and arguments, executes the actual Python code, and appends the results to the chat history using the specific tool role.
4. **Final Response**: The model processes the tool's execution result to generate a final, natural language answer for the user.

# FunctionGemma formatting and best practices

FunctionGemma is a specialized version of the Gemma 3 270M model,
trained specifically for **function calling** (i.e., tool use).

To manage the interaction between natural language instructions and structured,
tool-related data, FunctionGemma uses a specific set of formatting control
tokens. These tokens are essential for the model to distinguish between
conversation and data, and to understand tool definitions, tool calls, and tool
results.

## Base Prompt Structure

FunctionGemma builds on the [Gemma prompt structure](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/core/prompt-structure), using
`<start_of_turn>role` and `<end_of_turn>` to describe conversational turns.
The `role` is typically `user` or `model` (and sometimes `developer` for
providing initial context, as seen below).

The function-specific tokens are used *within* these turns to structure the
tool-related information.

### Control Tokens

FunctionGemma is trained on six special tokens to manage the "tool use"
lifecycle.

| Token Pair | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `<start_function_declaration>` `<end_function_declaration>` | Defines a tool. |
| `<start_function_call>` `<end_function_call>` | Indicates a model's request to use a tool. |
| `<start_function_response>` `<end_function_response>` | Provides a tool's result back to the model. |

> NOTE: `<start_function_response>` is an additional stop sequence for the
> inference engine.

### Delimiter for String Values: `<escape>`

A single token, `<escape>`, is used as a delimiter for **all string values**
within the structured data blocks.

- **Purpose:** This token ensures that any special characters (like `{`, `}`, `,`, or quotes) inside a string are treated as literal text and not as part of the data structure's syntax.
- **Usage:** All string literals in your function declarations, calls, and responses must be enclosed, like: `key:<escape>string value<escape>`.

## Training Scope and Limitations

FunctionGemma is trained for specific types of agentic workflows. It is
important to understand the model's training context to ensure reliability in
production environments.

### Supported Workflows

The model has been explicitly trained on **Single Turn** and **Parallel**
function calling.

- **Single Turn:** The user provides a query, and the model selects a single tool to address it.
- **Parallel:** The user provides a query containing multiple independent requests, and the model generates multiple tool calls simultaneously.

**Example: Parallel (Supported)**
> **User:** "What is the weather in Tokyo and what is the stock price of Google?"

The model generates calls for `get_weather(Tokyo)` and
`get_stock_price(GOOG)` in a single response. These actions don't depend on
each other.

### Unsupported Workflows

The model has **not** been explicitly trained on **Multi-Turn** or
**Multi-Step** workflows.
> **Note:** We expect the model to be able to generalize a bit to these
> scenarios, especially if fine-tuned on specific use cases, but it has not been
> trained to perform these tasks out of the box.

- **Multi-Step (Chaining):** Scenarios where the output of one tool is
  required as the argument for a subsequent tool.

  - **Example:** "Roll a die with 20 sides and check if the number is prime."
  - **Complexity:** This requires rolling a die first (Tool A), and *then* using the result to check if the number is prime (Tool B). FunctionGemma is not trained to reason through this dependency chain automatically.
- **Multi-Turn:** Scenarios requiring the model to maintain state or context
  over a long back-and-forth conversation to determine tool parameters.

> **User:** "Book me a table."  
>
> **Model:** "For how many people?"  
>
> **User:** "Four."

- **Complexity:** The model is not explicitly trained to aggregate these separate turns into a final `book_table(people=4)` call without external state management.

### Semantic Nuances

The model may sometimes miss the relationship between semantically related
concepts if the user's prompt is abstract or indirect.

Here's an example function.

    def get_current_temperature(location: str, unit: str):
        """
        Get the current temperature at a location.

        Args:
            location: The location to get the temperature for.
            unit: The unit to return the temperature in. (choices: ["celsius", "fahrenheit"])
        """
        return 22.0

For example, concepts like "cold" or "hot" imply temperature, but might not
immediately trigger a specific tool named `get_current_temperature` if the model
does not make the semantic connection in that specific context.

- **Mitigation Strategies:**
  - **Enriched Tool Definition:** This is often the most effective fix. Expanding the function's description to include semantic keywords helps the model bridge the gap. For example, adding "This function can be used to determine if the weather is hot or cold in a given location" to the docstring allows FunctionGemma to correctly map those qualitative descriptors to the tool.
  - **Prompt Engineering:** Making the user query more detailed or explicit can help the model trigger the correct tool, though this relies on user behavior.
  - **Fine-tuning:** For production environments where users frequently use highly indirect language (e.g., "is it nice out?" versus "get weather"), we recommend [fine-tuning](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/functiongemma/finetuning-with-functiongemma) the model on a dataset that explicitly maps these semantic nuances to the correct tool definitions.

**Example: Make Semantic Connection**
> **User:** "Hey, is it cold in Paris right now?"

**Scenario A: Limited Description** If the tool description is just `Get the
current temperature at a location.`, the model might fail to associate "cold"
with get_current_temperature and respond that it cannot provide weather
information.

**Scenario B: Enriched Description** If the tool description is updated to
include: `Get the current temperature at a location. This function can be used
to determine if the weather is hot or cold in a given location.`, the model
successfully makes the connection:  

`<start_function_call>call:get_current_temperature{location:<escape>Paris<escape>,unit:<escape>celsius<escape>}<end_function_call>`

## Example: Weather Tool Flow

Here is a complete, step-by-step formatted example demonstrating the flow for
using the `get_current_weather` tool.

![A diagram of Weather Tool Flow](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/images/functiongemma_flow.png)

### Turn 1: Tool Definition (Developer)

First, you provide the model with the definitions of all available tools. This
is done as the first turn from a `developer` role. This block is used to provide
the model with the "schema" of an available function, including its name, a
description of what it does, and its parameters.

It is important to include the system prompt `You are a model that can do
function calling with the following functions` to enable the model to call
tools. This phrase acts as a prompt-based trigger to switch between tooling
capability and general conversation.

```
<start_of_turn>developer
You are a model that can do function calling with the following functions<start_function_declaration>declaration:get_current_weather{description:<escape>Gets the current weather in a given location.<escape>,parameters:{properties:{location:{description:<escape>The city and state, e.g. "San Francisco, CA" or "Tokyo, JP"<escape>,type:<escape>STRING<escape>},unit:{description:<escape>The unit to return the temperature in.<escape>,enum:[<escape>celsius<escape>,<escape>fahrenheit<escape>],type:<escape>STRING<escape>}},required:[<escape>location<escape>],type:<escape>OBJECT<escape>}}<end_function_declaration><end_of_turn>
```

### Turn 2: User Prompt (User)

Next, the user asks a question that requires the tool you just defined.

    <start_of_turn>user
    Hey, what's the weather in Tokyo right now?<end_of_turn>

### Turn 3: Model Issues Function Call (Model)

The model processes the user's request and the tool definition. It determines it
needs to call the `get_current_weather` function and outputs the following turn.

    <start_function_call>call:get_current_weather{location:<escape>Tokyo, Japan<escape>}<end_function_call>

> **Application Logic:** At this point, your application must intercept this output. Instead of displaying it to the user, you parse the function call (e.g., `get_current_weather(location="Tokyo, Japan")`), execute this function in your own code, and get the result (e.g., a JSON object).

### Turn 4: Application Provides Function Response (Developer)

You now send the return value from your function back to the model. This turn
uses the function response tokens.

    <start_function_response>response:get_current_weather{temperature:15,weather:<escape>sunny<escape>}<end_function_response>

### Turn 5: Model Generates Final Answer (Model)

The model receives the function's result from Turn 4. It now has all the
information needed to answer the user's original question from Turn 2. It
processes this new context and generates the final, natural language response.

    The current weather in Tokyo is sunny with a temperature of 15 degrees Celsius.<end_of_turn>
